# W3M notes

renders pretty well in a browser, sharing a short list for usage here:

## usage notes
 
in order to enter text, press `enter` on the text field
to follow a link, press `enter`


- `shift t` - create new tab
- `B` - go back
- `{}` - switch between tabs
- `s` - switch between tabs with menu
- `/` - search forward
- `?` - search backward
- `cntl H` - history
- `q` - quit with prompt
- `Q` - quit without prompt
- `tab` - appears to act the same as in normal broswer

## copy paste

may interfere with tmux depending on bindings, personally Iuse the tmux bindings for copy paste
- `ctrl a esc ,` - copy paste supposedly (interferes with my tmux settings so I haven't tested)

for me the way to do this is:

- `cntl a {`
- `shift v`
- `arrow keys to select`
- `y` 

then to paste in vim
- `shift " + p`
